## Introduction

Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It is particularly useful for tasks that can be divided into similar subtasks. This repository showcases several classic problems solved using recursion in JavaScript.

## Examples

### Factorial

The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The factorial of 0 is defined as 1. This recursive approach involves a function calling itself with decremented values until it reaches the base case.

### Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The recursive function calls itself with the two preceding values to calculate the next number in the sequence.

### Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

The GCD of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without a remainder. This can be calculated using a recursive function that repeatedly applies the Euclidean algorithm.

### Power of a Number

Calculates the result of raising a base to an exponent. This recursive function multiplies the base by itself for the given exponent, reducing the exponent by one with each recursive call.

### Reverse String

Reverses a given string by recursively calling the function with the substring that excludes the first character, and appending the first character at the end.

### Sum of an Array

Calculates the sum of all elements in an array. This is achieved by recursively adding the first element of the array to the sum of the rest of the array.

## Use Cases of Recursion

Recursion is used in various scenarios where problems can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems. Some common use cases include:

1. **Mathematical Computations:** Factorials, Fibonacci series, GCD, power calculations.
2. **Data Structures:** Traversing trees and graphs (e.g., depth-first search, in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals).
3. **Algorithms:** Sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort), searching algorithms (e.g., binary search).
4. **String Manipulation:** Reversing strings, parsing nested structures.
5. **Dynamic Programming:** Solving problems with overlapping subproblems (e.g., memoization).

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion

### Advantages

1. **Simpler Code:** Recursive solutions can be more concise and easier to understand.
2. **Problem Solving:** Ideal for problems that can be broken down into similar sub-problems.
3. **Natural Fit:** Certain problems (e.g., tree traversal, factorial) are naturally suited to recursion.
4. **State Management:** Recursion automatically handles state through function call stack.

### Disadvantages

1. **Performance:** Recursive solutions can be less efficient due to repeated function calls and increased memory usage.
2. **Stack Overflow:** Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if the base case is not reached quickly enough.
3. **Complexity:** Recursive functions can be harder to debug and understand, especially for complex problems.
4. **Limited by Stack Size:** The depth of recursion is limited by the stack size, which can be restrictive for large inputs.

## Conclusion

This repository demonstrates the use of recursion to solve various problems in JavaScript. Recursion is a powerful tool in a programmer's toolkit, and mastering it can lead to elegant and efficient solutions for many problems.
