# Stack Data Structure in DSA
---
## What is Stack?
A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that operates on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It allows operations on elements in a specific order where the last element added is the first one to be removed.

## Advantages
- **Simplicity**: Stacks are easy to understand and implement.
- **Efficiency**: Push and pop operations are O(1) time complexity.
- **Memory Management**: Useful in managing function calls and recursion.

## Disadvantages
- **Limited Access**: Only the top element is accessible.
- **Fixed Size (for array-based stacks)**: Can lead to stack overflow if size limit is exceeded.
- **Lack of Flexibility**: Not suitable for scenarios requiring random access to elements.

## Real-Time Applications
- **Function Call Management**: Used to manage function calls and return addresses.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Helps in evaluating infix, postfix, and prefix expressions.
- **Syntax Parsing**: Essential in compiler design for syntax parsing and validation.
- **Undo Mechanism**: Implemented in text editors and applications for undo operations.
- **Browser History**: Manages navigation history in web browsers.
