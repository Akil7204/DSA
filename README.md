## Data Structures

### Arrays

- **Description:** A collection of elements identified by index or key.
- **Operations:** Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, Searching, Sorting
- **Complexity:** 
  - Access: O(1)
  - Search: O(n)
  - Insertion: O(n)
  - Deletion: O(n)

### Linked Lists

- **Description:** A linear collection of data elements where the linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
- **Operations:** Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, Searching
- **Complexity:**
  - Access: O(n)
  - Search: O(n)
  - Insertion: O(1)
  - Deletion: O(1)

### Stacks

- **Description:** A collection of elements that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Operations:** Push, Pop, Peek, IsEmpty
- **Complexity:**
  - Push: O(1)
  - Pop: O(1)
  - Peek: O(1)

### Queues

- **Description:** A collection of elements that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Operations:** Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek, IsEmpty
- **Complexity:**
  - Enqueue: O(1)
  - Dequeue: O(1)
  - Peek: O(1)

### Trees

- **Description:** A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single node as the root and sub-nodes as children.
- **Types:** Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.
- **Operations:** Insertion, Deletion, Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)
- **Complexity:**
  - Access: O(log n)
  - Search: O(log n)
  - Insertion: O(log n)
  - Deletion: O(log n)

### Graphs

- **Description:** A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them.
- **Types:** Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted
- **Operations:** Traversal (BFS, DFS), Shortest Path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
- **Complexity:**
  - Traversal: O(V + E)
  - Shortest Path: O(V^2) or O(E + V log V) with optimizations

### Hash Tables

- **Description:** A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.
- **Operations:** Insertion, Deletion, Search
- **Complexity:**
  - Average Case: O(1)
  - Worst Case: O(n)

## Algorithms

### Sorting

- **Types:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
- **Complexity:**
  - Bubble Sort: O(n^2)
  - Selection Sort: O(n^2)
  - Insertion Sort: O(n^2)
  - Merge Sort: O(n log n)
  - Quick Sort: O(n log n)
  - Heap Sort: O(n log n)

- **Types:** Linear Search, Binary Search
- **Complexity:**
  - Linear Search: O(n)
  - Binary Search: O(log n)

### Dynamic Programming

- **Description:** A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
- **Examples:** Fibonacci, Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence
- **Complexity:** Varies depending on the problem

### Greedy Algorithms

- **Description:** An algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit.
- **Examples:** Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, Huffman Coding
- **Complexity:** Varies depending on the problem

### Backtracking

- **Description:** A general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems.
- **Examples:** N-Queens Problem, Sudoku Solver, Subset Sum
- **Complexity:** Varies depending on the problem
